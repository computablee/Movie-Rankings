        <h2>About the List</h2>
        <p>These are simply my personal opinions based on my personal taste in movies. I claim in no way to be objective
            in how I rank movies, nor do I have a specific list of criteria upon which I decide where in this list a
            movie should go. This list is largely constructed via "feel." How I feel about the movie after watching it
            and how much personal enjoyment I got out of the movie is almost entirely the basis upon which I will rank
            it.</p>
        <p>With that said, here is my list. I am currently in the process of adding movies, and many of them I will need
            to rewatch to get an accurate judgment. Please be patient as I work through nearly every movie I've ever
            seen and quantify a rating!</p>
